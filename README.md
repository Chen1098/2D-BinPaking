## THIS IS DEVELOPED BY CHENXU1098

**To test this program, first run the file "数据随机生成" then run "大数据测试".**

The file out.txt stores the output after running "大数据测试" or "矩形排布" both files requires the input from “数据随机生成” or you could just delete the freopen and input manually. When program finished running, your output is stored in the file out.txt copy the svg code lines and paste them into a svg compiler to see the results. There will be two different svg code after you compile it. They are the original input and also the rectangle version.

This project is just at a beginning, as you can see, it's efficiency is rather low with polygons, but with rectangles, it's kinda okay.
